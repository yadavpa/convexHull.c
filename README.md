# Pre-processing Algorithm for Faster Convex Hull Computation 

Finding the convex hull of a point set has applications in research fields as well as industrial tools. This repository contains a C implementation of a pre-processing algorithm for computing convex hull vertices in a 2D spatial point set.

Following is the link to the paper referred for the implementation:
